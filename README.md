# jObserve
planning for astronomical observations

This stitches together PyEphem and astroquery to produce observing plots. It's like iObserve but for those of us who don't have apples

jObserve uses:
matplotlib http://matplotlib.org/
astroquery http://www.astropy.org/astroquery/
PyEphem http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/
